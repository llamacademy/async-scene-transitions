# Async Scene Transitions

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/UoiuKeyGjc8) learn how to implement a framework to manage animations between scenes. You'll learn how to use the SceneManager to asynchronously load scenes to get a lower amount of stutter when loading larger scenes. You'll also learn how to create ScriptableObject configurations for different animation transitions between the scenes to unlock limitless potential in your scene transition effects!

This repository mainly involves the `SceneTransitioner` which simply wraps the `SceneManager` and provides transitions as defined as concrete implementations of `AbstractSceneTransitionScriptableObject`.
